## Device Set-up
>As IoTivity is a framework for device-to-device connectivity, we must set-up a device we are going to use for this. As said in the Pre-Work section, we use a Ubuntu 15.04 Linux machine.
Follow the tutorial in the link below to set-up your Ubuntu Linux machine.

>The set-up intends to configure a connection between your device and Gerrit Code Review.
>There are 2 methods to get the source code.
*[Downloading most stable source from here.](https://www.iotivity.org/downloads)
*Getting source directly from gerrit.
>Download the source code and untar in a working folder.
>Once we have the source code in our folder, we need to do the following steps specified in the documentation page:
*Build the IoTivity project for Linux
*Run a sample
*Build the API reference documentation
