## Device Set-up
>As IoTivity is a framework for device-to-device connectivity, we must set-up a device we are going to use for this. As said in the Pre-Work section, we use a Ubuntu 15.04 Linux machine.
Follow the tutorial in the link below to set-up your Ubuntu Linux machine.

>The set-up intends to configure a connection between your device and Gerrit Code Review
